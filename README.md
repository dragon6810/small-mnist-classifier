# Small MNIST Classifier

## Building

NOTE: Building is only supported on unix-like systems
(Microsoft please make windows unix everybody would love you pleaseeee!!)

This project currently doesn't have any dependencies other than the MNIST dataset,
which is too big for Github.
To download the dataset, simply run getmnist.sh

    sh getmnist.sh
